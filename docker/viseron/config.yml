# Thanks for trying out Viseron!
# This is a small walkthrough of the configuration to get you started.
# There are far more components and options available than what is listed here.
# See the documentation for the full list of configuration options.

## Start by adding some cameras
ffmpeg:
  camera:
    camera_1:  # This value has to be unique across all cameras
      name: test
      host: 10.10.66.69
      port: 80
      path: .
      username: admin
      password: umoget56



## Then add an object detector
darknet:
  object_detector:
    cameras:
      camera_1:  # Attach detector to the configured camera_1 above
        fps: 1
        scan_on_motion_only: false  # Scan for objects even when there is no motion
        labels:
          - label: person
            confidence: 0.75
            trigger_recorder: true

      camera_2:  # Attach detector to the configured camera_2 above
        fps: 1
        labels:
          - label: person
            confidence: 0.75
            trigger_recorder: true


## You can also use motion detection
mog2:
  motion_detector:
    cameras:
      camera_2:  # Attach detector to the configured camera_2 above
        fps: 1


## To tie everything together we need to configure one more component.
nvr:
  camera_1:  # Run NVR for camera_1
  camera_2:  # Run NVR for camera_2

# Now you can restart Viseron and you should be good to go!
